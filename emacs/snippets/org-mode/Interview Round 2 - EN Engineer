Behavior Questions

# Is there a time that you started a project proactively? 

# Do you have any experience working with remote team? How do you handle the communication?

System Design
-----------------------
# Design backend for following/follower feature in Tiktok

Functionality:
User Profile Page
- Show a "follow" button if the vistor hasn't followed me yet. Otherwise, it will show a "unfollow" button.
- Show "# of followers" and "# of followings". When clicked, go to follower/following list page

Follower list page (Following list page is similar)
- Show a list of my followers ordered by time. People who followed me more recently will be shown on the top. 
- For each follower `X`, display basic info such as nickname, profile image etc. And also show a "follow" or "unfollow" button depending on whether the visitor has followed `X`.
- If the list is long, the visitor could scroll down the page, and more followers would be loaded incrementally.
