System Design
-------------
# Design backend for following/follower feature in Tiktok
Functionality:
User Profile Page
- Show a "follow" button if the vistor hasn't followed me yet. Otherwise, it will show a "unfollow" button.
- Show "# of followers" and "# of followings". When clicked, go to follower/following list page

Follower list page (Following list page is similar)
- Show a list of my followers ordered by time. People who followed me more recently will be shown on the top.
- For each follower `X`, display basic info such as nickname, profile image etc. And also show a "follow" or "unfollow" button depending on whether the visitor has followed `X`.
- If the list is long, the visitor could scroll down the page, and more followers would be loaded incrementally.

# Every product has its Privacy Policy, describing what information the app collects from users and for what purpose. How do you design a system to ensure what the app does complies with its Privacy Policy.

Example clause in Privacy Policy:
The app collects user's mobile phone number for the purpose of account registration and login.

So the product requriement is to implement "delete my acount" feature in the app. As a technical owner of the feature, how would you design and implement the feature?
